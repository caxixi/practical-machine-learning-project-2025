%# practical-machine-learning-project-2025

This repository contains the final project for the **Practical Machine Learning** course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The assignment uses the *Weight Lifting Exercises* dataset to build a machine learning model that classifies each observation into one of five categories. The dataset consists of measurements collected from accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six participants. Each class corresponds to a specific manner—correct or incorrect—of performing a lifting exercise.

We are instructed to cite the dataset source as: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>. As of the writing of this document, however, this link is no longer active, but the data can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/273/weight+lifting+exercises+monitored+with+inertial+measurement+units).
